<p>Here is the path I took to host my personal site with Strapi + Gatsby setup.</p>
<p>I had only one previous experience hosting a personal website, that was self hosting with <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> platform version 3. It was a good one with a very intuitive article creation and editing process.</p>
<p>I decided to try something else, and then learned there are headless CMS solutions which <em>may</em> work with any static site generator. Compared to Ghost, that would require me to manage 2 systems, plus figure out how to integrate them. I spent a day learning about existing offers (<a href="https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/">this</a> place is helpful), tried a few and quickly realized that the integration step is the main challenge in a split system approach.</p>
<p>At some point I was able to run a starter from Strapi that was already integrated with Gatsby:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>yarn create strapi-starter my-project gatsby-blog
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><a href="https://strapi.io/blog/build-a-static-blog-with-gatsby-and-strapi">Here</a> is a nice blog post about it also.</p>
<p>Then I made a docker container to deploy Gastby, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/pratclot/pratclot.com">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Strapi part required a bit of configuration before it was usable.</p>
<p>The uploads are stored in a directory local to backend code by default. These files are not going to survive if you decide to run the admin panel in a docker container. Placing them in a docker volume is the next reasonable thought, but it adds complexity to the setup. The ghost platform I used before used the database as a single source of truth by default.</p>
<p>I tried to integrate <code>strapi-provider-mysql-files</code>  found <a href="https://gitlab.com/themineraria/strapi_mysql_files">here</a>, as there is no official plugin / provider. The provider integration worked as written in README, however, at the time of writing, the code for the plugin was written for Strapi version 3, so I needed to adapt it to version 4. You basically need to generate a new plugin with this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>yarn strapi generate
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And then add the code from Cyprien&rsquo;s plugin to a middleware (or a controller, or elsewhere), enriched the plugin&rsquo;s config with SQL server parameters (as in v4 it seems you cannot access other plugin&rsquo;s configs), enable that middleware in <code>config/middlewares.js</code> (again, you probably can automate this by utilizing v4&rsquo;s plugin lifecycle API) and it should work.</p>
<p>After this I decided to use S3 instead. There is official support for it by Strapi, and they <a href="https://strapi.io/blog/how-to-set-up-amazon-s3-upload-provider-plugin-for-our-strapi-app">have</a> a nice blog post about it.</p>
<p>There is one additional step to make the thumbnails work in the admin panel in this setup. The bucket has to have a certain CORS policy configured:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[
  {
    &#34;AllowedHeaders&#34;: [&#34;*&#34;],
    &#34;AllowedMethods&#34;: [&#34;GET&#34;],
    &#34;AllowedOrigins&#34;: [&#34;YOUR STRAPI URL&#34;],
    &#34;ExposeHeaders&#34;: [],
    &#34;MaxAgeSeconds&#34;: 3000
  }
]
</code></pre><p>It is taken from <a href="https://github.com/strapi/strapi/tree/main/packages/providers/upload-aws-s3">here</a>. <code>AllowedOrigins</code> in my case looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[&#34;pratclot.com&#34;,  &#34;localhost:1337&#34;]
</code></pre><p>In case you need to further develop the project, you may want to enable GraphQL playground. For v4 there is a solution <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/73626902/13442292">here</a>, it will look like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// path: ./config/plugins.js

module.exports = {
  //
  graphql: {
    config: {
      endpoint: &#39;/graphql&#39;,
      shadowCRUD: true,
      playgroundAlways: true, &lt;----- this one
      depthLimit: 7,
      amountLimit: 100,
      apolloServer: {
        tracing: false,
        introspection: true, &lt;----- also this for production deployment
      },
    },
  },
};
</code></pre><p>Now, the content-types that represent the pages of the site are stored on disk, and there is no way to keep them together with other configurations in the database. This seems like a major turn-down that is not advertised.</p>
<p>Finally, the deployment. Strapi and Gatsby are located on different machines, so to deploy the site I run this improvisational script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/sh
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>set -e
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>yarn docker:frontend
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>docker save pratclot.com.frontend -o pratclot.com.frontend.tar
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>rsync -avz pratclot.com.frontend.tar myvps:~/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>ssh myvps <span style="color:#e6db74">&lt;&lt; EOF
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">    sudo docker load -i pratclot.com.frontend.tar &amp;&amp;
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">    sudo docker-compose -f \$(find . -type d -name pratclot.com)/docker-compose.centos.yml down &amp;&amp;
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">    sudo docker-compose -f \$(find . -type d -name pratclot.com)/docker-compose.centos.yml up -d &amp;&amp;
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">    curl https://pratclot.com --fail -I
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">EOF</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Basically, the above explains that I am too poor to have a container registry and k8s, so I transfer and run the container by hand :)��������������������</p>
