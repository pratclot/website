<p>Clonezilla allows to skip target disk size, and also has an option to create partitions on a new disk proportionally to the old ones.</p>
<p>In my case there was an HDD with 6 partitions and Windows 10, total size - 500 GB. The last three were C:, D: and the recovery image.</p>
<p>New SSD was only 240 GB, but as it turned out the partition backup made by Clonezilla took less than 200 GB.</p>
<p>For some reason, it was not possible to create partitions automatically - the creation of the last one would always get out of boundary and fail everything.</p>
<p>A comment <a href="https://superuser.com/a/1361409">here</a> hints that you can tell Clonezilla to skip partition creation altogether, and create them by hand yourself.</p>
<p>I ended up skipping D: and the recovery image and restoring only first 4 partitions. This worked well to boot Windows (but without recovery partition it was not possible to go to safe mode etc).</p>
<p>Now, the most interesting part. I used shell in Clonezilla to create the partitions. With the backup directory mounted, I located a partition table dump made by <code>sfdisk</code>. I have commented out last two partitions, and used <code>sfdisk</code> to restore the remaining 4 with the dump file. It was very handy to have this file there as I really did not want to know where each partition should start and end.</p>
