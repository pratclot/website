I finally figured what I want from my personal website.

Requirements:
- articles are stored as pure markdown
- it is relatively easy to host, i.e. a static website
- no database needed to store the content

Downside:
- cannot 

To ensure there are no typing errors in my articles I used an [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright) for VS Code. I am also wondering if there is a way to have context checks offline (like when Google Docs fixes conjugation errors).

GitHub Pages seem to think you are using Jekyll, and this will ruin paths for CSS files for example. Thankfully, it is [configurable](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66779408/13442292).
