My apartment was recently connected to Telekom's fiber network, and then the sales people really wanted me to join it too. I agreed to that since I had a 4G-based solution at the time which did not have great upload speeds.

On the installation day a "Glasfaser" box appeared in the apartment, and a month later I received a message that I could connect my router. The router activation website from Telekom mentioned a Speedport, a FritzBox and a Digitalisierungsbox. This gave me a hint that getting the Internet to actually work could be a challenge if I do not want a FritzBox for example.

I never used a FritzBox, and I never heard of it outside of Germany. Life taught me to stay away from choices which seem to be already made for me, so I looked online what other people's experiences were.

There is an [extremely nice article](https://jaseg.de/blog/telekom-gpon-sfp/) about an Ubiquiti router. I worked with MikroTik equipment before, but I never touched SFP anything, so this was a nice opportunity to get some more experience.

I ordered a `hAP ac` and the SFP module mentioned in the article.
