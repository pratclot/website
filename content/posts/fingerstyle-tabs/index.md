I learnt how to play things on the guitar mostly because of great tabs published at https://frettedinstrumentsnyc.com. For me this was the only way to stay learning, because just doing "exercises" makes no sense to my brain as there is no music produced that is remotely pleasurable to hear.

With the tabs you instead can already mimic your favorite tunes - all that is required is some technical work to make your fingers accustomed to the changes in chord shapes.

Because of this exposure to masterfully done tabs, after some years I found I can also put down some tunes which I learned by ear (and eyes). Below is the list of these horrible experiments so far:

Original Performer|Tune
-|-
Bruce Keener|[Son](https://github.com/pratclot/tunes/blob/master/pdf/Son.pdf)
Chet Atkins|[The House In New Orleans](https://github.com/pratclot/tunes/blob/master/pdf/The_House_In_New_Orleans.pdf)
Chet Atkins|[Zing Went The Strings of My Heart](https://github.com/pratclot/tunes/blob/master/pdf/Zing_Went_The_Strings_of_My_Heart.pdf)
Chet Atkins|[Chet's Tune](https://github.com/pratclot/tunes/blob/master/pdf/Chet's_tune.pdf)
Chet Atkins|[Humoresque / Swanee River](https://github.com/pratclot/tunes/blob/master/pdf/Humoresque_Swanee_River.pdf)
Odell Martin|[Hello Dolly](https://github.com/pratclot/tunes/blob/master/pdf/Hello_Dolly.pdf)
Jerry Reed|[Another Puff](https://github.com/pratclot/tunes/blob/master/pdf/Another_Puff.pdf)
Chet and Jerry|[I'll Say She Does](https://github.com/pratclot/tunes/blob/master/pdf/I'll_Say_She_Does.pdf)
Larry Odham|[Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams](https://github.com/pratclot/tunes/blob/master/pdf/Wrap%20Your%20Troubles%20In%20Dreams.pdf)
Hank Garland|[Sugarfoot Rag](https://github.com/pratclot/tunes/blob/master/pdf/Sugarfoot_Rag.pdf)
Arthur Smith & Chet|[Sweet Georgia Brown](https://github.com/pratclot/tunes/blob/master/pdf/Sweet_Georgia_Brown.pdf)
Chet Atkins|[Man of Mystery](https://github.com/pratclot/tunes/blob/master/pdf/Man_of_Mystery.pdf)

I create the tabs with MuseScore3 since I like Linux more. I use GitHub to store them, so don't hesitate to correct me via issues!

There are also many places where I found the inspiration to continue learning (with eyes and an unhealthy dose of rewinding):
